### Proposal Services

We recognize that every pursuit is unique and carefully map resources to requirements, providing end-to-end Capture Services, Proposal management and  coordination, price-to-win strategy, and conceptual artists/graphic artists as needed.  Our resources have experience with various capture and proposal methods, and have successful records of winning Federal work.  


The development and delivery of a proposal in response to a solicitation is the final step in our client’s opportunity pursuit.  Creating and producing a winning proposal is not only hard work, it’s often in addition to already busy schedules, important operational demands and budget constraints. The Edgewater Group's Proposal Services team provides clients the required resources, processes and tools to lead the response effort and increase the win-probability. As shown below, The Edgewater Group's proposal teams follow adaptable processes and procedures with milestone reviews (color team reviews) throughout the proposal lifecycle.
