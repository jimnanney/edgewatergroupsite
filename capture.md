### Capture services

The Edgewater Group now offers Capture Services in response to our clients’ request for this kind of support. As an outgrowth of our Advisory Services that focuses on acquisition excellence and strategic partnership with the Government, The Edgewater Group's Capture Services focus on helping our clients not only prepare to win strategic pursuits but also successfully deliver successful mission support after award. Our Capture and Proposal expertise, with reach-back to Advisory Services, dramatically increases the probability of a win, but for The Edgewater Group, it’s not enough to win; we work with our clients to ensure they can deliver on their promises.

Our Capture practice is rooted in the Shipley process and is highly adaptable to fit our clients’ needs or established practices. These services can be harnessed for unique purposes.
